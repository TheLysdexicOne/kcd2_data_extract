        "1. In the first chapter, Aristotle proves that the world is perfect in both quantity and size.<br/>\n2. In the second chapter, he explains how bodies in the world are capable of three simple movements.<br/>\n3. In the third chapter, he applies his observations regarding local movements to several earthly bodies.<br/>\n4. In the fourth chapter, he presents five reasons why, in addition to the four elements, it is necessary to assume another simple body.<br/>\n5. In the fifth chapter, he shows that the heavens are neither heavy nor light.<br/>\n6. In the sixth chapter, he suggests that the heavens could neither have been created, nor corrupted, nor increased, nor decreased, nor changed.<br/>\n7. In the seventh chapter, he presents three proofs of what he has just stated.<br/>\n8. In the eighth chapter, he shows that circular movement is not contradictory.<br/>\n9. In the ninth chapter, he aims to determine whether there exists any infinite body.<br/>\n10. In the tenth chapter, he shows that it is impossible for a body moving in a circle to be infinite.<br/>\n11. In the eleventh chapter, he shows that no body capable of straight-line motion can be infinite.<br/>\n12. In the twelfth chapter, he shows that neither heaviness nor lightness can be infinite.<br/>\n13. In the thirteenth chapter, he broadly argues that no body can be infinite, basing his reasons on the rules governing local movement.<br/>\n14. In the fourteenth chapter, he shows that no body can be infinite, using reasons based generally on all types of movements or actions.<br/>\n15. In the fifteenth chapter, he presents other, more general and less obvious reasons to show that no body can be infinite.<br/>\n16. In the sixteenth chapter, he proposes to determine whether there exist or can exist multiple worlds, and with two arguments proves that they cannot.<br/>\n17. In the seventeenth chapter, he proves with another argument that there can only be one world.<br/>\n18. In the eighteenth chapter, he proves that the elements move to certain specific places without the distance to them being infinite, which he had previously assumed.<br/>\n19. In the nineteenth chapter, he refutes views contrary to what is stated in the previous chapter.<br/>\n20. In the twentieth chapter, he again proves with two reasons that there can be only one world.<br/>\n21. In the twenty-first chapter, he presents the reason why some believed that multiple worlds could exist.<br/>\n22. In the twenty-second chapter, he finds an answer to the above argument, thereby confirming his view.<br/>\n23. In the twenty-third chapter, he shows that no living body can exist outside this world, which he had previously assumed.<br/>\n24. In the twenty-fourth chapter, he shows that there is nothing concerning a living body outside this world.<br/>\n25. In the twenty-fifth chapter, he begins to question whether the world is eternal, and discusses the views of other ancient thinkers.<br/>\n26. In the twenty-sixth chapter, he refutes Plato's view.<br/>\n27. In the twenty-seventh chapter, he refutes the views of Empedocles and Anaxagoras.<br/>\n28. In the twenty-eighth chapter, he precisely explains various concepts that he will continue to use.<br/>\n29. In the twenty-ninth chapter, he addresses the problem of the possible and the impossible with respect to a given force.<br/>\n30. In the thirtieth chapter, he asserts and begins to prove that everything that had a beginning, and all things subject to change, will have an end, and also that everything that ends had or will have a beginning.<br/>\n31. In the thirty-first chapter, he tries to prove as a universal law that what is not without a beginning is not without an end, and if it is not without an end, then it is not without a beginning; also, that what has no beginning is eternal, and if it is eternal, it is without a beginning.<br/>\n32. In the thirty-second chapter, he shows how certain concepts used in this area of study are translatable.<br/>\n33. In the thirty-third chapter, he again tries to prove that everything that had a beginning will necessarily have an end, and that everything that will have an end had a beginning.<br/>\n34. In the thirty-fourth chapter, he further argues the same problem.<br/>\n35. In the thirty-fifth chapter, he defends the idea that all perishable things will necessarily be destroyed, and further argues the previous question.<br/>\n36.

Many people came every day to Ka\u0148ek and Kukl\u00edk to seek their fortune on the surface and underground. There was so much pure silver flowing out of the furnaces that even the last miner could get rich if he had not drunk it all before or had not met with misfortune in the mine. And those who didn't return were not few. But nothing could discourage the profitable miners from opening new shafts.</paragraph><paragraph>Along with the miners, rich merchants also came to Kutn\u00e1 Hora, who rented the mines from the king to extract white metal from them at their own expense and thus increase their wealth even more. To prove that they were successful in their work, the patricians began to build exhibition houses and palaces, and soon a large town with several markets and a town hall was established. A little later, high walls were also erected to guard the peace and wealth of the upper town.</paragraph><newpage><paragraph>One of the first to come to the mountain to try their luck was the German Ruthard family, who established a manor on Kolmark above the river Vrchlice, where silver in the knickerbockers rose to the surface in abundance and had therefore been mined here for ages. Jan Kunkl\u00edn Ruthard was a well-known miner and erckaufier in Kutn\u00e1 Hora, so when King V\u00e1clav II himself visited Kutn\u00e1 Hora, he offered him a treat in his house. The king, impressed by the choice food and the wealth of Ruthard's house, realised that Jan must be well versed in silver mining, since he was doing so well. </paragraph><paragraph>What was the king's astonishment when, after a good meal, John took him into the cellar, where the silver bars lay on top of each other like ears of silver in a sheaf. Then the king asked John for the first time: Whose silver is all this, Ruthard? And he answered him wisely: Thy king, if ever thou hast need of it from me. The king, pleased with these words, shook his head and told John that he had no need of it yet, but would remember it.</paragraph><paragraph>Later John accompanied King Wenceslaus to Vespers in the monastery of Sedlec. On the way, the king asked his guide who owned the meadows they were passing through, and John told him: You, gracious king! But I manage them, and I pay every year ten white groschen to the abbot of the monastery for their use. </paragraph><paragraph>The king promised to intercede, and in good humour turned his horse to a willow tree that grew by the roadside. He broke off a branch from it and handed it to John, saying: Let this sprig be a reminder to posterity of my grace for the sincerity with which you have shared your treasures with me.</paragraph><paragraph>Ruthard understood the king's words, and while Wenceslaus stayed in the monastery, he hastened to the city, where he had the royal hand and the sprig painted on his shield. When Wenceslas saw the new decoration on his shield, he confirmed the coat of arms and with it the dignity he had achieved for his family that day.</paragraph>",

After thirty days of truce, both armies were once again preparing for battle. On the night before the battle, <accent>Andromeda</accent>, Hector's wife, had a terrible vision that her husband would not escape death the next day. In the dark of the night, she immediately revealed everything to her husband and begged him not to go into battle, but Hector harshly rebuked her, saying that it was not fitting for warriors to flee from the fight because of deceptive dreams.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Andromeda ran to the king and queen to implore them to forbid their son from going into battle, warning that they would surely be burying him if they did not. They all knelt before Hector, pleading with him in tears, but he ignored them and prepared for battle. He mounted his horse and rode out before the assembled Trojan army.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Then began the terrible battle between the Achaeans and the Trojans, with countless men attacking each other so fiercely that a thousand died on the spot before the ranks even clashed. Amid the calls of horns and the sounds of pipes, the Greek king <accent>Menelaus</accent> struck hard at the Syrian allies, but the Trojans did not let them fall, and the battle raged fiercely where it had previously calmed. There fought <accent>Troilus</accent>, there his rival King <accent>Telamon</accent>, and elsewhere <accent>Achilles</accent> and his Myrmidons were pushing the Trojans back toward the city. So many heroic deeds were performed in such a short time.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph><inc>A</inc>chilles planned to capture the Trojan prince <accent>Margaretis</accent>, but killed him in the battle. When Prince Hector saw this, he immediately launched an attack with his men, killing many Greek nobles. Achilles quickly realised that fortune was turning against the Achaeans and would not allow them to triumph over the Trojans. But then <accent>Polices</accent>, the betrothed of Achilles' sister, arrived on the battlefield with his men and attacked Hector, who killed him. Thus, the two princes finally faced each other in battle, seeking vengeance for their fallen comrades.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Achilles first attacked Hector, but Hector wounded him in the thigh with a spear, forcing his enemy to withdraw from the fight to have his wound bandaged.

        "<paragraph><inc>T</inc>hus begins the story of the killing of the heroic <accent>Hector</accent>, the Trojan prince, which occurred in the tenth year of the war between the Achaeans and the defenders of the city of Troy. After thirty days of truce, both armies were once again preparing for battle. On the night before the battle, <accent>Andromache</accent>, Hector's wife, had a terrible vision that her husband would not escape death the next day. In the dark of the night, she immediately revealed everything to her husband and begged him not to go into battle, but Hector harshly rebuked her, saying that it was not fitting for warriors to flee from the fight because of deceptive dreams.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Andromache ran to the king and queen to implore them to forbid their son from going into battle, warning that they would surely be burying him if they did not. They all knelt before Hector, pleading with him in tears, but he ignored them and prepared for battle. He mounted his horse and rode out before the assembled Trojan army.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Then began the terrible battle between the Achaeans and the Trojans, with countless men attacking each other so fiercely that a thousand died on the spot before the ranks even clashed. Amid the calls of horns and the sounds of pipes, the Greek king <accent>Menelaus</accent> struck hard at the Syrian allies, but the Trojans did not let them fall, and the battle raged fiercely where it had previously calmed. There fought <accent>Troilus</accent>, there his rival King <accent>Telamon</accent>, and elsewhere <accent>Achilles</accent> and his Myrmidons were pushing the Trojans back toward the city. So many heroic deeds were performed in such a short time.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph><inc>A</inc>chilles planned to capture the Trojan prince <accent>Margaretis</accent>, but killed him in the battle. When Prince Hector saw this, he immediately launched an attack with his men, killing many Greek nobles. Achilles quickly realised that fortune was turning against the Achaeans and would not allow them to triumph over the Trojans. But then <accent>Polices</accent>, the betrothed of Achilles' sister, arrived on the battlefield with his men and attacked Hector, who killed him. Thus, the two princes finally faced each other in battle, seeking vengeance for their fallen comrades.</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>Achilles first attacked Hector, but Hector wounded him in the thigh with a spear, forcing his enemy to withdraw from the fight to have his wound bandaged. Later, as Achilles was searching for his foe, he saw that Hector had captured a Greek lord and was therefore without a shield. He spurred his horse and struck Hector so hard in the chest that the prince fell dead on the spot.

These patterns, used by magicians in their rituals or as talismans, take the form of rings connected by various lines. The rings represent planets, and the lines are like rays that flow from them through infinite space to Earth.</paragraph><newpage/>"

He was an example to his people and a ruler more pleasing than all; he always negotiated with his enemies in good terms, and they had to bow down before his piety. He glorified God with all his heart and did so many good deeds that it would be impossible to count them.<br/> <br/>"

But few can point out someone's faults in such a way that the unfortunate person notices them without causing public ridicule.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>I will tell you of a lady who mastered this art. She was not only clever and quick in speech, but also young and beautiful to look at. When she appeared in society, men flocked to her. The young men asked her to dance and offered their arms, the older ones asked for her hand in marriage and offered what little the old men could still give to the young lady.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Suddenly a young man asked her to dance. He had a handsome face and fine manners, so the lady accepted his proposal. After a few steps, however, she realized that she had made a big mistake. The dancer seemed to have two left feet. He stumbled, tripped, almost fell several times, and despite his apologies, the lady found dancing with him a torture. The other dancers noticed this, and began to whisper and point in their direction.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Any other would have embarrassed him with indiscriminate words. She might even have sued the other ladies to watch out for the losers. Not the lady in my story. What does it matter if he's a bad dancer? she said to herself. Others may dance with ease, but they also drink with it, indulge in dice and light girls. Better a bad dancer than a good drinker.\n<paragraph>So she smiled and said out loud for all to hear, \"Young sir, how I would love to keep dancing with you. But I wore the wrong shoes today. They're pushing me so hard that I can't go on.

        "<newpage/><heading>About an Eloquent Lady and a Bad Dancer</heading>\n<paragraph>It is known that anyone can point out someone's shortcomings and bring shame upon them. But only few can point out someone's faults in such a way that the unfortunate person notices them without causing public ridicule.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>I will tell you of a lady who mastered this art. She was not only clever and quick in speech, but also young and beautiful to look at. When she appeared in society, men flocked to her. The young men asked her to dance and offered their arms, the older ones asked for her hand in marriage and offered what little the old men could still give to the young lady.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Suddenly a young man asked her to dance. He had a handsome face and fine manners, so the lady accepted his proposal. After a few steps, however, she realized that she had made a big mistake. The dancer seemed to have two left feet. He stumbled, tripped, almost fell several times, and despite his apologies, the lady found dancing with him a torture. The other dancers noticed this, and began to whisper and point in their direction.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Any other would have embarrassed him with indiscriminate words. She might even have told the other ladies to watch out for such loser. Not the lady in my story. What does it matter if he's a bad dancer? she said to herself. Others may dance with ease, but they also drink with it, indulge in dice and light girls. Better a bad dancer than a good drinker.\n<paragraph>So she smiled and said out loud for all to hear, \"Young sir, how I would love to keep dancing with you. But I wore the wrong shoes today. They're pushing me so hard that I can't go on. Please escort me out into the fresh air.\"</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Her dancer quickly understood what she meant by that remark and hurriedly walked with her to the door. Everyone present thought that perhaps she was going to give him a hard time at the door, or give him a well-deserved slap.

But his name was also Hermann Knauser!\n<paragraph>Knauser was renowned in the town for his wealth, but his avarice was the talk of the region. He had the most beautiful house in the best quarter and liked to invite visitors who admired its decoration. When it came to entertaining, however, he gave them dry bread, lest they should eat of the delicacies he kept for himself.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>One day, a painter who had formerly also stayed at the royal court came to town. So to have him paint something for me would surely be the envy of all! thought Mr. Knauser, and the next day he invited the master to his house. He took him through the rooms, showing him the costly furniture, fabrics, and statuettes with which they were decorated. The painter watched everything, but said nothing.</paragraph>\n<paragraph>Finally, Mr. Knauser told him:</paragraph>\n<paragraph>\"Master, you see that my house contains the best of all kinds of art. I have seen the works of various artists, and few things can surprise me yet, let alone make me pay for it. What do you think, master, can you paint something like this?\"</paragraph>\n<paragraph>The master, who had long ago guessed Knauser's character, shook his head and replied:</paragraph>\n<paragraph>\"I'm sure he did.

Its effects are truly mercurial, causing the test subjects to run hither and thither at great speed, although they themselves naively reported that this was due to a sudden pressing urge to defecate and urinate. Running at speed is certainly a useful skill for messengers, although the tendency of the subjects to run away from people rather than towards them is admittedly a disadvantage. However, I do not despair. I still believe the addition of other ingredients, such as bittersweet nightshade, orchis mascula, or perhaps maybe calla and butterbur might reduce the side-effects and allow me to create true messengers of the gods.</paragraph><newpage/>"
